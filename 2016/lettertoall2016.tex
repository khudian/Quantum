Subject: Letter from Hovik Khudaverdian


             Dear colleagues and dear students,
    There is a project that I have been thinking about for many years and
finally I decided to give it a try:
an experimental course ``Topics in Quantum Mechanics'.
    Over years I have heard from some PhD students that they would like to
learn basics of this subject. Some of them made attempts to attend the
corresponding course in the School of Physics, and these students told
me that it would be nice and more efficient if this course would be
delivered specially to mathematicians.
    I am planning a course oriented towards graduate students in
Mathematics. I plan to give about 8-10 lectures. Many things will depend
on the people who will come to listen the course.
    Below you can see a preliminary version of the programme of the course.
Sure it is a very preliminary version.
 	I need to know:
1) how many people approximately  will attend the course
2) your opinion about the programme.
    Those who are interested to attend the course, please respond to this
letter. I will be happy to receive any comments about the programme below.
 	After 21 September I will send the letter to fix the day
and time for the course.

                         Hovik
