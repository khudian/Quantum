         Dear colleagues and dear students
    First of all   let me apologise  for the second  mass e-mail,
  (The first letter was sent in the summer when many people
were not available.)  All other e-mails  will be sent to the
dedicated mailing list only. 

   As I told in the previous letter  the next week I will begin to 
 read the course  "Mathematcial aspects of  Quantum Mechanics"  
(see attached file for the details).
  We will meet on Thursdays in Frank Adams from 11-1pm (with a short break).
The first lecture will be the next week,  on Thursday 27  September.
   Also we will have one or two tutorials. (The timing will be fixed
during the lecture)
   The lectures will be addressed not only to PhD students, 
but to anybody who would have an interest in Quantum Mechanics.
   There  will be an assessment (see the file attached), however this is not
compulsory.

   


   All the best

       Yours

                                       HMK
